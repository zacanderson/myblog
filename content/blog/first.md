This is an initialization post, so I suppose it should be considered "zeroth," since we're all aware that arrays begin at zero (except when they dont).

Look forward to more entries once this site is fully operational, which I don't expect to take long. Zola has been a very straightforward process to use and I'm looking forward to writing a blog post about the experience.
