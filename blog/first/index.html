<p>This is an initialization post, so I suppose it should be considered &quot;zeroth,&quot; since we're all aware that arrays begin at zero (except when they dont).</p>
<p>Look forward to more entries once this site is fully operational, which I don't expect to take long. Zola has been a very straightforward process to use and I'm looking forward to writing a blog post about the experience.</p>
